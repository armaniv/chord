# Chord
This project implements "Chord: A Scalable Peer-to-peer Lookup Protocol for Internet Applications" algorithm. All the informations about protocol specifications can be found in the original paper.

## Requirements
* Java 11 
* [Eclipse IDE Version: 2019-06 (4.12.0)](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2019-06)
* [Symphony Version: 2.7](https://repast.github.io/)
* [gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) (OPTIONAL)

## Simulator configuration
Our simulator is based on Repast Symphony, an agent-based modeling toolkit
and  cross-platform  Java-based  modeling  system.   This  technology  allows
represent graphically a complex system with the usage of efficient visualization
features. Data for statistics is collected using Repast and analyzed with gnuplot.

## Installation
* Clone the repository
* Import the project as a Repast project into Eclipse IDE
* Run the project

## Simulation parameters
When the simulator is running, a GUI is showed to the user which presents some input boxes that can be used to modify the parameters of the simulation. These parameters are well described in the report.


## Test
In order to test the implementation we have three types of statistics which can be computed and analyzed:
!!!!! ToDo!!!!
